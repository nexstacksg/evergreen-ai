# 01 — Discovery Brief

## Problem
Evergreen teams spend too much time manually reading supplier/customer documents, retyping into ERP templates, creating marketplace content, and drafting quotations.

## Goal
Build an AI-assisted operations workspace that:
1. Ingests documents from email/WhatsApp/folders
2. Extracts structured data with OCR + LLM
3. Enables human verification before ERP export
4. Accelerates marketing content generation
5. Accelerates quotation drafting
6. Supports B2B ordering with contract pricing, consignee, and cost-centre control

## Scope (Phase 1)
- Document processing + verification + ERP Excel export
- Marketing content generation with approval queue
- Quotation suggestion + branded output
- Customer portal ordering basics (contract pricing visibility, consignee, cost centre, order status tracking)

## Success Signals
- 50%+ reduction in manual data entry time
- Lower extraction/typing errors
- Faster quotation turnaround
- Faster listing creation for Shopee/Lazada
- Accurate order lifecycle tracking
