# US-002 — Customer-Specific Pricing in Portal

As a B2B customer user,
I want to see only the products/prices allowed by my pricing policy,
so that I place valid contract-compliant orders.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Customer profile controls visibility mode (contract-only / all)
- Prices come from valid date-bound customer price book
- Non-visible items are hidden from browse/search
- Selected items keep resolved unit price in order snapshot
