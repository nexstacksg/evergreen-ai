# US-004 — Supplier Name to SKU Learning Map

As a sales admin,
I want manual product matches to be remembered per supplier,
so that future documents are auto-matched more accurately.

## Acceptance Criteria
- User can manually map supplier item name/SKU to internal product SKU
- Mapping is supplier-scoped and reusable in future extractions
- System shows suggested mapping confidence and allows override
- Mapping edits are versioned/audited
