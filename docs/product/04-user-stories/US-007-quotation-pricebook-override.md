# US-007 — Quotation Suggestion with Price-Book Override

As a sales user,
I want AI quote suggestions to consider history and customer price book,
so that quoted prices are both relevant and compliant.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Quote suggestions include frequently bought items from customer history
- Pricing prioritises valid customer price-book rules over generic catalogue price
- UI shows price source (history / price book / catalogue)
- Sales can override price with mandatory reason capture (configurable)
