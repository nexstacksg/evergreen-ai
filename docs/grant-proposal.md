## 1.2 Business Background

Evergreen Group Pte Ltd is a well-established Singapore office supplies company founded in 1978, serving corporate clients, schools, and government organisations for over 45 years. The company distributes a wide range of office products including stationery, paper products, printing supplies, and office equipment through both B2B direct sales and online marketplaces (Shopee.sg, Lazada.sg).

With 20 employees across sales, marketing, and operations, Evergreen manages a product catalogue of over 5,000 SKUs and serves approximately 1,000 corporate customers. The company faces increasing competitive pressure from online retailers and large distributors, making operational efficiency and digital capabilities critical to maintaining market position and enabling growth.

Evergreen currently operates a custom ERP system for inventory and order management but relies heavily on manual processes for document handling, e-commerce content creation, quotation management, and corporate customer ordering — areas where AI and digital automation can deliver significant productivity improvements.

---

# 2. Problem Statement

## 2.1 Industry Context

Singapore's office supplies distribution industry is characterised by thin margins, high transaction volumes, and increasingly demanding corporate customers who expect fast turnaround, accurate pricing, and self-service ordering capabilities. While large distributors have invested in enterprise-grade systems, SMEs like Evergreen operate with legacy tools and manual workflows that limit scalability.

The rise of AI and e-commerce has created both a threat and an opportunity. Companies that fail to digitise risk losing customers to online platforms; those that adopt AI-powered automation can dramatically improve efficiency and customer experience.

## 2.2 Current Process & Pain Points

Evergreen's daily operations involve several manual, time-consuming processes:

1. **Document Processing** — Sales staff manually process 30–50 incoming documents daily (invoices, purchase orders, delivery orders) arriving via email, WhatsApp, and scanned paper. Each document requires **5–10 minutes** of manual data entry into spreadsheets for ERP import.

2. **E-commerce Listing Creation** — Marketing staff manually create product listings for Shopee and Lazada: photographing products, removing backgrounds, writing descriptions. Each SKU takes **20–30 minutes** to list, with 500+ products in the backlog.

3. **Quotation Preparation** — Sales staff manually prepare quotations for corporate customers by looking up past purchase history, current pricing, and typing out quotation documents. Each quotation takes **30–45 minutes**.

4. **Corporate Customer Ordering** — Corporate customers must call, email, or WhatsApp to place orders. Sales staff manually process these into the ERP system, taking **10–15 minutes per order**. There is no self-service ordering capability.

5. **Price Management** — Maintaining contract pricing for ~1,000 corporate customers is done via spreadsheets. Checking the correct price for a customer-product combination takes **3–5 minutes** and is error-prone.

6. **Customer Support** — Enquiries about pricing, order status, and product availability are handled ad-hoc via phone and WhatsApp, with no centralised tracking or history.

## 2.3 Key Challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|:----------|:-------|
| Manual document processing | 4+ hours/day of repetitive data entry; frequent errors in ERP data |
| Slow e-commerce listing creation | 500+ product backlog; losing online sales to competitors |
| Manual quotation preparation | Sales team spends 40% of time on admin instead of selling |
| No self-service ordering for corporates | Customers wait hours for order confirmation; lost orders |
| Spreadsheet-based pricing | Pricing errors; no audit trail; risk of revenue leakage |
| No budget visibility for corporate customers | Customer overspending; manual budget tracking |

## 2.4 Business Impact

For Evergreen's current operation with **20 employees, 1,000 corporate customers, and 50+ daily documents**:

- **Document processing:** 50 docs × 8 min = **6.7 hours/day**
- **E-commerce listings:** 15 SKUs × 25 min = **6.3 hours/day**
- **Quotation preparation:** 10 quotes × 38 min = **6.3 hours/day**
- **Order processing:** 30 orders × 12 min = **6.0 hours/day**
- **Price checking & management:** 30 lookups × 4 min = **2.0 hours/day**

**Total: Over 27 man-hours per day** consumed by manual processes that can be automated with AI. This is equivalent to **3.4 full-time employees** dedicated entirely to administrative tasks, representing approximately **SGD 120,000/year** in labour cost that could be redirected to higher-value activities.

# 4. Proposed Solution

## 4.1 System Overview

**Evergreen AI** is a unified web-based platform with two integrated portals:

1. **Operations Portal (Internal)** — AI-powered document processing, e-commerce content generation, and quotation management for Evergreen's sales and marketing teams.

2. **B2B Procurement Portal (Customer-Facing)** — Self-service ordering platform for corporate customers with personalised contract pricing, budget controls, and AI-powered quick ordering.

Both portals share a common product catalogue and customer database, enabling seamless data flow between internal operations and customer-facing services.

---

# 11. Justification for Government Support

## 11.1 SME Constraints

Evergreen Group is a 20-person SME with SGD 1.5M annual revenue operating in a low-margin industry:

- **Capital Constraints** — The SGD 98,000 development cost represents 6.5% of annual revenue, a significant investment for a traditional wholesale business. Government co-funding would de-risk the digital transformation.
- **Technology Gap** — As a 45-year-old company, Evergreen has deep industry expertise but limited in-house technology capability. External vendor development is necessary.
- **Competitive Pressure** — Larger distributors and online platforms are capturing market share. Without AI adoption, Evergreen risks being left behind.

## 11.2 National Strategic Alignment

| National Initiative | Evergreen AI Alignment |
|:-------------------|:----------------------|
| **Smart Nation** | Brings AI/LLM technology to a traditional wholesale SME; demonstrates accessible AI adoption |
| **Retail ITM** | Leverages AI for operational efficiency and omni-channel commerce (marketplace + B2B portal) |
| **National AI Strategy 2.0** | Practical enterprise AI with measurable outcomes across document processing, content generation, and pricing |
| **SME Go Digital** | Comprehensive digitalisation of a long-standing SME — from manual to AI-powered operations |
| **Productivity Drive** | 75%+ productivity improvement with annual savings exceeding SGD 93,000 |

## 11.3 Multiplier Effect

- **Industry-wide example** — Demonstrates that AI adoption is feasible and profitable for traditional wholesale/distribution SMEs across Singapore.
- **Customer ecosystem** — 1,000 corporate customers benefit from self-service ordering, budget tools, and faster service.
- **Job quality improvement** — Staff are freed from repetitive data entry to focus on sales, customer relationships, and business development.

## 11.4 Distinction from Existing Projects

This project is a **completely new, independent initiative** that does not overlap with any existing grant-funded projects. The Evergreen AI platform is being built from scratch with new AI capabilities and a new B2B customer portal that do not exist in Evergreen's current systems.
